# PostgreSQL MCP Setup Prompt

## Goal
After creating a PRD, determine if the project requires database functionality and guide setup of PostgreSQL MCP integration if needed.

## Process
1. **Review the PRD**: Analyze the requirements to see if database functionality is needed
2. **Ask clarifying questions**: Confirm database needs based on PRD requirements
3. **Guide MCP setup**: If yes, provide setup instructions for PostgreSQL MCP integration
4. **Proceed with task generation**: Continue to task generation with or without database setup

## Database Assessment Questions
Based on the PRD, ask the user:
- "Looking at your PRD, this feature will need to store/retrieve data. Do you have an existing PostgreSQL database?"
- "Would you like to set up PostgreSQL MCP integration for real-time database inspection during development?"
- "What type of data storage does this feature require based on the PRD requirements?"

## Setup Instructions
If the user needs database functionality:

1. **Review the setup guide**: Point them to `.cursorrules/setup-postgres-mcp.md` for detailed setup instructions
2. **Configure MCP**: Help them set up the PostgreSQL MCP server using the example config in `.cursorrules/postgres-mcp-config.example.json`
3. **Test connection**: Verify the setup is working before proceeding

## Integration with Workflow
- **After PRD creation**: Run this assessment based on PRD requirements
- **Before task generation**: Ensure database setup is complete if needed
- **During task generation**: Tasks can reference actual database schema and relationships
- **During implementation**: Real-time database queries help validate data requirements

## Output
Once database assessment and setup is complete or skipped, proceed with task generation:
1. Use `@.cursorrules/step-03-generate-tasks.mdc` for task breakdown (will include database setup tasks if needed)
2. Use `@.cursorrules/step-04-task-list.mdc` for implementation tracking

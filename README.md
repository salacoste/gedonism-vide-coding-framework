## ⚡️ Preconfigured for Next.js, NestJS, Tailwind — Instantly Adaptable to Any Stack

Gedonism comes preconfigured for automatic project generation using **Next.js** (frontend), **NestJS** (backend), and **Tailwind CSS** (styling). This means you can start building modern, full-stack applications out of the box with best practices and strict rules enforced for these technologies.

**However, Gedonism is designed to be stack-agnostic and can be quickly adapted to any programming language, framework, or package ecosystem.**

### How to Adapt Gedonism to Your Stack

1. **Update Rule Files**
   - Edit or replace the rules in `.cursorrules/` (e.g., `frontendrules.mdc`, `backendrules.mdc`) to reflect the conventions, best practices, and style guides of your chosen language or framework (e.g., Python, Go, Ruby, Java, React, Vue, Django, Flask, etc.).
   - You can add new rule files for additional stacks or remove those you don't need.

2. **Modify .mdc Workflow Files**
   - Adjust the workflow files (`01-create-prd.mdc`, `03-generate-tasks.mdc`, etc.) to reference your new or updated rules and to generate tasks/code in your target language or framework.
   - Update prompts and instructions to guide the AI for your specific stack.

3. **Adjust Project Templates and Examples**
   - Replace or supplement example code and templates in the `examples/` directory to match your stack.
   - Update the `INITIAL_EXAMPLE.md` and `INITIAL.md` files to provide relevant documentation and gotchas for your technology choices.

4. **Update Configuration**
   - If your stack requires different tools for code formatting, linting, or testing, update the configuration files (e.g., `package.json`, `.eslintrc`, etc.) accordingly.
   - For database integration, adjust the MCP server configuration or add new MCP integrations as needed.

5. **Revise README and Documentation**
   - Update this README and any other documentation to reflect your chosen stack, rules, and workflow.

**With these simple changes, Gedonism can serve as a powerful AI-driven foundation for any language or framework.**

## Project Workflow

### 1. **Backend Rules ([backendrules.mdc])**
- Enforces naming, typing, class/function structure, and SOLID principles for NestJS/TypeScript.
- Requires JSDoc for public APIs, no `any`, no magic numbers, and comprehensive test coverage.

### 2. **Frontend Rules ([frontendrules.mdc])**
- Modern TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS only.
- Clean, readable, modular code with up-to-date best practices.
- All comments and error handling in English.

### 3. **Database via MCP Postgres ([setup-mcp-postgres.md], [postgres-mcp-config.example.json])**
- AI can directly inspect and query PostgreSQL schemas and data.
- Secure credential management via environment variables.
- Enables real-time schema analysis, reporting, and test data generation.

### 4. **Context Management ([context7autoinvoke.mdc])**
- Automatic connection to Context7 MCP server for enhanced context and search.
- AI leverages all project rules and documentation for code generation.

### 5. **AI Workflow via .mdc Files**
- **01-create-prd.mdc**: Generate a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for clear feature definition.
- **02-setup-postgres-mcp.mdc**: Assess and configure database integration if needed.
- **03-generate-tasks.mdc**: Create a detailed, actionable task list from the PRD.
- **04-task-list.mdc**: Execute tasks step-by-step with review and quality control.

---

## Recommended Development Sequence

1. **Create a PRD**  
   Use `.cursorrules/01-create-prd.mdc` to generate a Product Requirements Document.
   ```
   Use @.cursorrules/01-create-prd.mdc
   Here's the feature I want to build: [feature description]
   ```

2. **Database Assessment**  
   If your feature requires data, set up MCP Postgres with `.cursorrules/02-setup-postgres-mcp.mdc`.
   ```
   Use @.cursorrules/02-setup-postgres-mcp.mdc
   Reference my PRD: @tasks/prd-MyFeature.md
   ```

3. **Generate Tasks**  
   Create a detailed task list from the PRD using `.cursorrules/03-generate-tasks.mdc`.
   ```
   Now take @tasks/prd-MyFeature.md and create tasks using @.cursorrules/03-generate-tasks.mdc
   ```

4. **Step-by-Step Task Execution**  
   Use `.cursorrules/04-task-list.mdc` to work through tasks one at a time, with review and feedback.
   ```
   Please start on task 1.1 and use @.cursorrules/04-task-list.mdc
   ```

5. **Review and Iterate**  
   After each step, review the output, provide feedback, and iterate as needed.

## Project Setup (From Scratch)

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vibe-coding-boilerplate.git my-project
   cd my-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - For backend and frontend, run `npm install` or `yarn install` in the respective directories (if present).
   - Ensure Node.js is installed for MCP Postgres integration.

3. **Configure MCP Postgres**
   - Create a database user and grant permissions (see [setup-mcp-postgres.md]):
     ```sql
     CREATE USER mcp_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password';
     GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE your_database TO mcp_user;
     GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO mcp_user;
     GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO mcp_user;
     ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO mcp_user;
     ```
   - Set the connection string in environment variables or in Cursor's `settings.json` (see [postgres-mcp-config.example.json]).

4. **Test the Connection**
   - Restart Cursor.
   - Ask:
     ```
     Can you show me what tables are available in my database?
     ```
   - Ensure the AI can see your database structure.

5. **Follow the Workflow**
   - Proceed with the step-by-step workflow described above.

## Best Practices

- **Keep files under 200 lines**: Use modularization to maintain readability and context.
- **Write tests**: Unit and e2e tests for every public method/controller.
- **All comments and error handling in English.**
- **Use only modern technologies and syntax** (ES+, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind).
- **Never store secrets in code**: Use environment variables.
- **Continuously update AI context**: Add new rules, docs, and examples as the project evolves.
